            Our first award ceremony at Unnati Welfare Society was a proud and memorable occasion. We were honored to receive certificates of recognition from the Block Education Officer (BEO) of Bhagalpur on 7th May 2024, acknowledging our impactful work and dedication to community development. This milestone serves as a testament to our commitment to creating positive change at the grassroots level.
